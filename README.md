# VidFrameFetcher
This script automates the process of extracting frames from videos at specified intervals using FFmpeg. The extracted frames are saved as high-quality JPEG images. It provides a user-friendly command-line interface where users can specify the input video file, output directory, and the desired time interval between the extracted frames.
